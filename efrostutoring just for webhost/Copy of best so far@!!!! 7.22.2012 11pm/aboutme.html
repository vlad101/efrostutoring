				<tr>
					<td><p id="p1">I have more than 6 years of intensive research in chemistry and I have started 
					my own tutoring business in order to help students who really need help in Math and Science; that
					is what I have been doing full-time since 2005. My first tutoring experience was as a self-employed tutor in 2005 and 
					I have been teaching and tutoring for most of my free time since then. I am mentoring students at all levels of science 
					and mathematics on a regular basis. I am currently an active member of the American Chemical Society. As a graduate student 
					I work as a teaching assistant in charge of chemistry labs, grading exams, keeping records of grades, laboratory safety inspections, 
					and I aid in other relevant tasks. <br /> Many of my students score above average on their exams. I try to simplify the material wherever possible and design 
					my instruction to each individual's needs. I am a strong believer in the importance of education and emphasize that 
					education is the only path to success<br /><br />Thanks & Regards,<br />Vladimir Efros</p></td>

						<p>"I got my grade for my final exam and guess what I got an A thanks to you really 
						appreciate it" -Igor, Fall 2010 <br /><br />"I wish I had found you earlier in the school year. You are 
						a lifesaver and you even helped me to gain confidence and believing I could do this math and pass. 
						Thank you so much for the extra mile to help me understand the concepts." -Eric, Spring 2010 <br /><br />
						"My performance has improved dramatically. I truly appreciate your help with my chemistry class. I 
						am more confident with math and I am hoping my final semester exam will be much improved. You were 
						very professional for all sessions. You exceeded my expectations and I plan to use your services in 
						the future." -Emily, Summer 2009<br /><br />"You are a very friendly and an open person.  You know and love 
						physics and all the math that is related to it. You explain the concepts in a very simplified way. 
						The tutoring was successful. I earned an A this semester. Thank you very much for all your help!" 
						-Michael, Fall 2008</p>
